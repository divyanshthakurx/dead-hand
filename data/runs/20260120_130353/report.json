                    "The prompt 'Allow Spotify to find, connect to, and determine the relative position of nearby devices?' is worded to sound non-threatening. This might fall under the category of Visual Misdirection. It asks for location permissions, potentially more precise location data than what the user would intuitively expect, for the stated purpose of playing on all your devices, which seems vague and might not be the primary reason. This could be seen as obfuscating the real function of the data collection. The buttons themselves have an equal apparent weigh and so do not seem manipulative in construction.",
                    "The app claims the user is 'in control' and can change permissions at any time, which mitigates concerns. The text below 'To find and play on all your devices' could make the user think clicking 'Don't allow' would restrict the functionality of playing music - implying permission here is forced."
